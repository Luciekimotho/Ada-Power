    <h4>Nairobi Dev School</h4>
    <p>Nairobi dev School is similar to Hacker School in that the students will be becoming better programmers. It willll be, however, a little different in its structure. After doing some research and consulting, we decided that Nairobi developer School should be more of a beginners program. We are going to use the Jumpstart Lab curriculum in our training. We shall also have resident and remote developer mentors to guide the students as they learn.</p>
